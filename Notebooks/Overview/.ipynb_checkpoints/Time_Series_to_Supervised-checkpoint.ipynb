Thetransform both informs what the model will learn and how you intend to use the model in the future when making predictions, e.g. what is required to make a prediction $(X)$ and what prediction is made $(y)$. For a univariate time series problem where we are interested in one-step predictions, the observations at prior time steps, so-called lag observations, are used as input and the output is the observation at the current time step. For example, the above 10-step univariate series can be expressed as a supervised learning problem with three time steps for input and one step as output, as follows:"
